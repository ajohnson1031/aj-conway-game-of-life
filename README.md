# Conway's Game of Life - AJ Edition

Conway's game of life is a well-known algorithm that makes use of an easy-to-follow deterministic pattern moving cells on a grid through the life/death cycle via a preconfigured set of parameters. My visualization allows an end-user to view an animation of this pattern by selecting their own patterns on the grid, or by generating a randomized start pattern.

## Motivation

The idea is mainly to display an algorithmic process in action in an optimized way. This project is a test of skill for a developer, and I am passionate about improving my skillset through learning.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
